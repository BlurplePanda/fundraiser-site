    <p>Welcome to Rundfaise! We are a fully New Zealand owned and operated fundraising platform.</p>
    <img id='home-page-image' src='images/givinglove.png' alt='A cartoon hand holding/giving a love heart'>
    <p>Rundfaise provides a service for users to create and/or pledge to fundraising campaigns. Users are able to create
        fundraising campaigns for various charities, by creating an account as a fundraiser.
        Users are also able to pledge to campaigns using the built-in form. Please note, pledges are
        promises, not payments - no actual money is processed through Rundfaise.</p>
